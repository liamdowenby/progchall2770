# progchall2770
Welcome to my repository for my Programming Challenges for CSC 2770!

Each challenge is divided into its own folder with the required C program(s) and Makefile. 
I included the instructions just in case with each challenge.

Note: for challenge 2, two SSH windows must be open. 
  The first must be actively running the server
  The second will run the client and output the expected response
